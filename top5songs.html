            <p>1988, I used to think of my little suburb as being the most most boring suburb one could find themself in. It wasn't, I just didn't know better. Anyway, I viewed my hometown as suburbia and this song just made sense to me for that reason. To be clear, I was (am) an idiot and just couldn't appreciate where I was or how hard my parents worked to be there.</em> 
        <p>Underappreciated music video, too. Simple, creative, captures the music. </p>
            <p>Side note: FYC put out two incredible albums and called it a day. I wonder if they had it them for one more.<br />

            <p>… That's great, it starts with an earthquake/ Birds and snakes, and aeroplanes
/ And Lenny Bruce is not afraid
/ Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn
/ World serves its own needs
/ Don't mis-serve your own needs
/ Speed it up a notch, speed, grunt, no, strength
/ The ladder starts to clatter
/ With a fear of height, down, height
/ Wire in a fire, represent the seven games
/ And a government for hire and a combat site
/ Left her, wasn't coming in a hurry
/ With the Furies breathing down your neck
/ Team by team, reporters baffled, trumped, tethered, cropped
/ Look at that low plane, fine, then
/ Uh oh, overflow, population, common group
/ But it'll do, save yourself, serve yourself
/ World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed
/ Tell me with the Rapture and the reverent in the right, right
/ You vitriolic, patriotic, slam fight, bright light
/ Feeling pretty psyched
/ It's the end of the world as we know it
/ It's the end of the world as we know it; It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine
/ Six o'clock, T.V. hour, don't get caught in foreign tower
/ Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn
/ Lock him in uniform, book burning, bloodletting
/ Every motive escalate, automotive incinerate
/ Light a candle, light a motive, step down, step down
/ Watch your heel crush, crush, uh oh
/ This means no fear, cavalier, renegade and steering clear
/ A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies
/ Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives and I decline
/ It's the end of the world as we know it (I had some time alone)
/ It's the end of the world as we know it (I had some time alone);
It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine (time I had some time alone);
I feel fine (I feel fine);
/ The other night I drifted nice continental drift divide
/ Mountains sit in a line, Leonard Bernstein
/ Leonid Brezhnev, Lenny Bruce and Lester Bangs
/ Birthday party, cheesecake, jellybean, boom
/ You symbiotic, patriotic, slam but neck, right, right
/ It's the end of the world as we know it (time I had some time alone);
It's the end of the world as we know it (time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine (time I had some time alone)

            <p>What a recording. That trumpet at the beginning and through the song is amazing. Good music-video, too. For a long time I feel that design students, like myself at the time, were moved to major in design and art because of album art, music videos, and comic books. Guilty. The album packaging and photography for <em>Ophelia</em> is wonderful. But, who buys hard copies of their music anymore? </p><br />

            <p>I would like to tell you that my knowledge in pop and music history is such, that I was always aware of how good Nick Drake was as a songwriter. No, there was a revival in his music somewhere in the late 90s. I think I first heard this track in a commercial for the autombile company, Volkswagon; and again in the sound track for the rom-com movie, <em>Serendipity</em>. Posthumous commercial success aside, what a beautiful song.</p><br />

            <p>I remember this track and album clearly. I just finished grad school when this album came out and it stayed in my car for at least a year. The track is sad, and beautiful, melodic and universal.</p><br />
